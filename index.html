		<h3 id="educationHeader" class="pSubHeaders">Education</h3>
		<p>I attended high school at South Carroll High. After graduating, I attended Carroll Community College for 2 years where I obtained my Associate's Degree in General Studies in May of 2013. I then transferred to Towson University, graduating with my Bachelor's
			degree in Information Technology in May of 2015.</p>

		<h3 id="experienceHeader" class="pSubHeaders">Experience</h3>
		<p>I do not have <em>too</em> much experience with designing or developing websites. In my past, I have taken an introductory level web development course during my undergrad. The course was fairly useful in getting me introduced to the basics of web development.
			Also, at work I have been exposed to HTML and CSS when I was working with Selenium to automate certain front-end tests for our web applications. It has been a while since I have done any HTML or CSS related activities at work, however, and I consider
			myself a novice in the field.</p>

		<h2 id="workshopExpectHeader" class="pHeaders">Workshop Expectations</h2>
		<p>I hope I am able to utilize the information and experience I gain in this course in my future, both professionaly and personally. I want to be able to better understand what is involved in web design and web development so that I can do my job as QA
			analyst better. In addition to performing better at work, I also hope that the skills obtained in this course will be able to help me in my personal life for any side projects that I may want start on my own!</p>

		<h2 id="goalsHeader" class="pHeaders">Goals</h2>
		<p>A few of my goals for 2017 are below:</p>

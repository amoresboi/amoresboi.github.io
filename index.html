		<h1>Hola! My name is Marco,<br/>
		I'm a QA Analyst from Baltimore.</h1>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
	   	<p>I am creating a website as part of <strong>Betamore's Learn to Code: Build a Website in a Weekend</strong> workshop! I am very excited to learn new skills in this course. Some things I am most passionate about are listed below:</p>
	   	<ol>
	   		<li>Playing video games</li>
	   		<li>Practicing photography</li>
	   		<li>Exercising</li>
	   		<li>Traveling the world</li>
	   		<li>Learning new things</li>
	   	</ol>

		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>I attended high school at South Carroll High. After graduating, I attended Carroll Community College for 2 years where I obtained my Associate's Degree in General Studies in May of 2013. I then transferred to Towson University, graduating with my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology in May of 2015.</p>

		<h3>Experience</h3>
	   	<p>I do not have <em>too</em> much experience with designing or developing websites. In my past, I have taken an introductory level web development course during my undergrad. The course was fairly useful in getting me introduced to the basics of web development. Also, at work I have been exposed to HTML and CSS when I was working with Selenium to automate certain front-end tests for our web applications. It has been a while since I have done any HTML or CSS related activities at work, however, and I consider myself a novice in the field.</p>

	   	<h2>Workshop Expectations</h2>
	   	<p>I hope I am able to utilize the information and experience I gain in this course in my future, both professionaly and personally. I want to be able to better understand what is involved in web design and web development so that I can do my job as QA analyst better. In addition to performing better at work, I also hope that the skills obtained in this course will be able to help me in my personal life for any side projects that I may want start on my own!</p>

   		<h2>Goals</h2>
   		<p>A few of my goals for 2017 are below:</p>
   		<ul>
   			<li>Obtain ASTQB Advanced Level Test Analyst Certification</li>
   			<li>Complete at least 3 Betamore Workshops</li>
   			<li>Learn at least 2 new skills relating to Information Technology</li>
   		</ul>
